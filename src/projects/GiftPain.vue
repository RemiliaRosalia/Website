      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
          Gift of Pain is a in-progress 3D Action Game staring a Mall Santa fighting mutant children who don't like the presents they got.
          I serve as the Lead 3D artist, in charge of creating various assets, including Santa himself.

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>
          Gift of Pain was born out of a failed freelance project that two others and I were hoping to do.
          After that, we decided to bring on another friend and join a holiday Game Jam with the prompt of Giving.
          We decided to go with the idea of giving pain and then Gift of Pain was born.
          Here we decided on going for a low poly 3D action game.
          Once the Game Jam ended, we decided that we'd continue the project in hopes of one day finishing it.

      <p>
        My first goal with this project was to create the main character, Santa.
        This included making the model itself, along with UV mapping, rigging, and animating him.
        I also created many of the props for the Mall the game takes place in featured below.
        The setting of a mall allowed us to get creative with what we can include, allowing me to make a wide variety of different models.
      </p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Before this project, I had minimal experience with modeling people, expecially an exagerrated one like this Santa.
        As a result, the first version did have issues, especially regarding animating.
        Because of this, I decided to try again from scratch the second Santa model ended up looking more refined and was easier to animate.
