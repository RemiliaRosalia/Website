          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Journeys and Jazz: The Fruits of the Gods is a turn-based RPG created in RPG Maker MZ. 
            It features the four characters of Leonard, Seleth, Dreck, and Tezca as they explore the modern fantasy world of Eclysia for the titular Fruits of the Gods.
            The story will take place over 6 parts with parts 1 and 2 currently released and part 3 nearing completion.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>Journeys and Jazz: The Fruit of the Gods (JNJ)'s story originated from my first ever Tabletop RPG campaign, using my original system, Journeys and Jazz.
            The game not only retells that story but features additional content that went unused in the campaign.
            I originally started this project as my Senior Thesis and currently am continuing to work on it in my spare time.
            One of my main focuses in this project is to have a game that can be comedic but also is not afraid to take itself seriously.
            Along with this, I value the expressiveness of the characters which is showcased through their many different portrait expressions.

            I find it very engaging to work on the combat system. 
            I work as hard as I can to make each skill a character gets interesting and to keep each playable character balanced with one another.
            One way I worked to give player's choice in combat is through equipment. 
            In JNJ, every item adjusts stats by a % rather then a flat value.
            This allowed me to keep items worthwhile throughout the game, including weapons.
            Each weapon is designed to fit a slightly different playstyle, making them sidegrades rather than upgrades.
            An example of this can be seen with three of Dreck's weapons. 
            The Cactus grants Dreck a higher attack boost than his other choices but he takes damage each turn.
            The Limbo Pole instead sacrifices attack in exchange for allowing Dreck to act more often.
            The standard Log instead is more balanced, boosting his defense and attack, making it the best general pick.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            While RPG Maker MZ makes the creation progress much easier with its premade assets, engine, and combat systems, this has the downside of being less customizable.
            I have occassionally struggled to implement my ideas due to it's restrictions though I have been able to still succeed whether it be by finding plugins that add functionality
            or editing the engine's code myself.
            I have also numerous times during my work on JNJ, faced creative burn out.
            This was especially difficult to pull through in Part 3 which features many more NPCs than Part 1 and 2 combined.
            I found switching my focus to other aspects or different projects helped greatly with giving me time to create more NPC ideas.
