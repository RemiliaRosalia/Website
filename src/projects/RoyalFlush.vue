      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Royal Flush is a gambling themed turn-based RPG starring Tim?, Roulette, and Gimble as they use their gambling skills to fight through the casino and save Tim?'s sister.'
        This prototype features 2 combat scenarios where you can learn the basics of each character's ability and respective gambling mini-game.   
      </p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>I worked on this prototype with 4 others.</p>
      <p>My goal was to balance combat along the gambling minigames for each character.</p>
      <p>These minigames include Slots, High or Low, and Blackjack.</p>
      <p>Before starting development in Unity, we decided to make a physical prototype of the combat system to test our idea's potential.</p>
